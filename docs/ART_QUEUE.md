# Art queue (Codex)

Images are generated with Codex from the prompt files and pushed to the `art/codex` branch.
Each improvement run checks that branch. When images are there, Claude installs them, verifies the scenes, merges,
and moves the batch to "Done" below.

## Waiting for Codex

| Batch | Prompts | Files | Lands in | Then (Claude) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (nothing waiting) | | | | |

When a new batch is added:
- **Portraits:** cut out with `tools/art/cutout_portrait.py`, convert, and add the character to `EXPRESSIONS` in `src/components/story/art.ts`.
- **Backgrounds:** resize to 1080x1920, convert (backgrounds use WebP quality 72), and add the key to `PAINTED_BGS` in `src/story/chapterScene.ts`.

## Done

- Prologue cast: Layla (5 expressions), Noura (4), Rashid (3).
- Prologue backgrounds: street, courtyard, dallah.
- Chapter cast (batch 2): Faisal, Tariq, Lama, Sultan (4 expressions each).
- Chapter locations (batch 2): Sadu corner, Ramadan lanterns, Jeddah, AlUla, Taif, Abha, Al-Ahsa, Riyadh, Khobar.
- Batch 3: title key art (`bg_title`, on the title screen on phones), Rashid happy and worried (ally path), finale background (epilogue).
